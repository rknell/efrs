<h3>Important Information About Platform Permissions</h3>

<p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without
    your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform
    will alert you the first time the ExampleCo app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent
    (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the ExampleCo app seeks before
    you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.</p>

        whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.
