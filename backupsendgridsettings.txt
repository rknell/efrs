# SendGrid configuration
#
# The original repository contained real SendGrid credentials. They have been
# removed. Provide your own credentials via environment variables, for example:
#
#   SENDGRID_APIKEY=<your api key>
#   SENDGRID_USERNAME=<your username>
#   SENDGRID_PASSWORD=<your password>
#
# Never commit live credentials to source control.
